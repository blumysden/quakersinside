One of the reasons I appreciated about the Quakers was because they didn't specify that you had to be any type of religion.  You could just come, quiet worship, get your thoughts together, do what you needed to do, and go... The Quaker group gave me everything I needed to help me: encourage me with education -- I got a couple degrees while I was inside, I learned the American Sign Language while I was inside -- and I'm just glad to be here.

The men that came to this worship group were very thoughful and self-reflective people.
I find that it's been an important experience in my life for a couple of reasons:
sometimes at Otisville is where I most palpably feel or have an experience of the divine
it's a two-way street
I always come away from there feeling that it was worth my while to have gone...I always felt like I got something out of it, and I always come back feeling grateful for simple things.

This started [attending the worship group at Attica] in 1982, and I'm still going to Quaker service, although I'm outside. I've been out since 2008.  One of the things that helped propel me through that journey was those outside volunteers.  You know, they gave me hope, they gave me a base to operate from, they gave me a sense of worth, a sense that someone cared about me... I was very, very helpful to be with them... I really enjoyed being with the Quakers, they gave me the fulfillment that one needs under those type of circumstances.

Carl Dukes, member of Attica Worship Group


I'm very impressed with the quality of worship, the sharing.  I have friends on the inside.  And they will be my friends for a very long time.
