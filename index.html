      <p>The New York Yearly Meeting includes 8 worship groups and meetings within New York State Prisons.  These meetings bring incarcerated men and women together with attenders from across the state in the spirit of fellowship and community.</p>

      <p>Meetings take place once or twice a week, and generally include both silent worship and discussions of social and personal matters.  Many groups also undertake projects: writing minutes or articles, planning quarterly meetings, writing and sharing poetry, raps, and essays.  We support each other through personal struggles, celebrate accomplishments like the awarding of academic degrees, and help our incarcerated members build solid foundations for a successful transition from prison to civilian life.</p>

      <p><strong>We are looking for new regular attenders at our meetings, but we welcome those who would like to attend even once.</strong>  You do not have to personally identify as a Quaker to join us.</p>

      <p>Information on individual worship groups and <a href="#volunteering">how to attend</a> can be found below.  For questions on groups not found below, or any more general questions, please email quakersinside@googlegroups.com.</p>

      <h3>Why We Attend</h3>

      <figure class="quote">
        <blockquote>[I started attending the worship group at Attica] in 1982, and I'm still going to Quaker service, although I'm outside. I've been out since 2008.  One of the things that helped propel me through that journey was those outside volunteers.  You know, they gave me hope, they gave me a base to operate from, they gave me a sense of worth, a sense that someone cared about me... It was very, very helpful to be with them... I really enjoyed being with the Quakers, they gave me the fulfillment that one needs under those type of circumstances.</blockquote>

          <blockquote>I find that it's been an important experience in my life for a couple of reasons:
          sometimes at Otisville is where I most palpably feel or have an experience of the divine...
          I always come away from there feeling that it was worth my while to have gone...I always felt like I got something out of it, and I always come back feeling grateful for simple things.</blockquote>

        <figure class="quote">
          <blockquote>One of the reasons I appreciated about the Quakers was because they didn't specify that you had to be any type of religion.  You could just come, quiet worship, get your thoughts together, do what you needed to do, and go... The Quaker group gave me everything I needed to help me: encourage me with education -- I got a couple degrees while I was inside, I learned the American Sign Language while I was inside -- and I'm just glad to be here.</blockquote>

      <ul class="schedule">
        <li>Meeting for Worship, Sundays, 8:15am to 11am</li>
        <li>Meeting with a Concern for Business, Thursdays, 6pm to 8pm</li>

      <p>The Sing Sing Worship Group was formed in TKTK.  Ten to fifteen attenders gather togther most Thursdays and Sundays for silent worship, discussion, and project planning.  Some of the men have been members of the group for years; some will be visiting for the first time at a friend's urging.  New visitors from the prison or civilian population are always welcomed in warmly.</p>

      <p>Our discussions range over many topics, but frequently concern spiritual growth, what it is to be and become "a man", healing from past struggles and traumas, and bringing our hard-won insights and the best of ourselves back to our communities outside the prison walls.</p>

      <p>Sing Sing Correctional Facility is a men's prison in Ossining, New York, 40 miles north of New York City.  Metro North's Hudson line serves Ossining Station, which is 1 mile from the prison.</p>

      <h4>How to Attend</h4>

      <p>Attenders must apply for volunteer status according to the New York State Department of Corrections &amp; Community Supervision guidelines <a href="#volunteering">outlined below</a>.

      <h3 id="volunteering">Volunteering in New York State Prisons</h3>

      <p>Getting approval from the New York State Department of Corrections &amp; Community Supervision to attend our meetings can take a month or more, but it's worth the time and effort.  If you have any concerns about the process outlined below, don't hestitate to contact us at quakersinside@googlegroups.com for more information.</p>

      <p>Under normal circumstance, the minimum age for a volunteer is 21.  Please note that volunteers are prohibited from corresponding, visiting (with the exception of during volunteer activities), or accepting telephone calls from inmates at any DOCCS facility unless they receive permission.</p>

      <p>Before first attending a meeting, you will have to apply for "Occassional Volunteer" status with the New York State Department of Corrections &amp; Community Supervision.  This will allow you to attend up to six times in a given year.  Fill out the <a href="http://www.doccs.ny.gov/directives/MFVS3080.pdf">Volunteer
Registration Form (MFVS3080)</a>, parts I and II, and send it to the contact person listed above for the group you'd like to attend.</p>

      <p>As part of your application process, the Departmentâ€™s Employee Investigation Unit will perform a criminal background check.  You must also be skin tested for TB; this test may be performed by your own physician.</p>

      <p>Once you have been approved as an Occassional Volunteer, you may begin attending meetings.  Co-ordinate your first visit with the contact person for your group.  Occassional Volunteers must arrange for a pass ("gate clearance") with the prison's volunteer co-ordinator before each visit; we recommend submitting your request about a week before you plan to visit.</p>

      <p>If you decide to become a regular attender, you can apply for Regular/On-going Volunteer status.  This will allow you to attend as many scheduled worship group meetings as you like, and you will not be required to arrange gate clearance before visiting.</p>

      <p>Applicants for Regular/On-going Volunteer status will need to attend an orientation session at the prison, and be fingerprinted.  Once your application has been approved, you will be issued an official ID card to be kept on file at the prison gate.</p>

      <p>Complete details about the NYS DOCCS Volunteer Services Program can be found <a href="http://www.doccs.ny.gov/Directives/4750.pdf">here</a>.  A list of requirements for each type of volunteer is <a href="http://www.doccs.ny.gov/directives/4750B.pdf">here</a>.</p>

      <h3>Quaker Prison Ministry<br/>and Criminal Justice Advocacy</h3>

      <p>Since the Seventeenth Century, Quakers have worked to improve living conditions for imprisoned people, to make penal codes more humane, and to abolish the death penalty.</p>

      <p>William Penn's "Great Experiment" of the 1680's reserved capital punishment for the crime of murder alone, and strove for the humane rehabilitation of prisoners, In 1817, Elizabeth Gurney Fry began the first Quaker prison ministy, tending to physical and spiritual needs of the women of London's Newgate Prison, and testifying before the House of Commons about the injustices and abuses she observed.  To this day, Quakers actively advocate for the rights of prisoners of conscience, abolition of solitary confinement, and the development of restorative justice programs.</p>
